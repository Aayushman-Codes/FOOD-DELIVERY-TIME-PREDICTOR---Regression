# FOOD DELIVERY TIME PREDICTOR - Regression
**Food delivery time prediction Model using logical and linear regression** 
This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or thw use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle.

2) Create a new Notebook.

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project into your new notebook.

4) Run the notebook to see the output.

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: Regression (Linear & Logical) [Machine Learning]

Objective:  The goal od this model is to predict food delivery times based on customer location, restaurant location, weather, traffic, and other factors. This involves both data preprocessing and building predictive models using linear regression and logistic regression.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
